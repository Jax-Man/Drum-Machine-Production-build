# Drum Machine
***
## play around with it ~cleveland jr.~[here](https://jax-man.github.io/Drum-Machine-Production-build/)

### this product shows how I would go about the basics for designing an interactive beat player
***
### It has:
1. 9 beats you can play with
2. associated keys on your keyboard. NOTE: if you have something other than a qwerty keyboard I'm pretty sure its still the left 9 keys in those spots
3. styling to make it look like they are being pressed
4. a display that shows what sound is playing

### What I want to include: 

1. a volume slider
2. a pack of my own beats ~(megalovania)~ something simple and memey
3. some animation that looks like a bubble pop on top of the buttons
